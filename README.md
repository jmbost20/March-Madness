# March Madness- ML Clustering and EDA

***See file mm_a.ipynb for code

### Overview (TL:dr)
This project uses historic data on March Madness games from 1985-2016 to explore occurrences of lower seed teams winning in March Madness. By analyzing this data using machine learning clustering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to gain insights into patterns and trends that can inform future March Madness predictions.
