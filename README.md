# March Madness- ML Clustering and EDA

***See file mm_a.ipynb for code

### Overview (TL:dr)
This project uses historic data on March Madness games from 1985-2016 to explore occurrences of lower seed teams winning in March Madness. By analyzing this data using machine learning clustering techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to gain insights into patterns and trends that can inform future March Madness predictions.

## Motivations
As an aspiring basketball player, basketball analytics has always been fascinating! This project was a first step in using Data Science skills that I learned in school in an extracurricular context, and it has brought me great joy to see how far I've come since creating it.

## Usage
To use this project, simply download the repository and open the Jupyter notebook mm_a.ipynb in a Jupyter environment such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. From there, you can run the code and explore the results.
