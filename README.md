* *(Scroll for more); Also reference .ipynb for relevant code*

### Project Goal
The Goal of this project is to gently compare common colloquial strategies to some industry level standards with March Madness bracket predictions.

### Overview (TL:dr)
* Use historic data on March Madness games from 1985-2016 to explore occurrences of lower seed teams winning in March Madness. This includes using EDA to visualize the frequency and time periods, as well as using Clustering to predict, when the lower seed team will win based on a variety of variables
